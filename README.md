## Paragraphs

In Slim you would use `|` (pipe) to mark a line of text. Thats fine for oneliners.
If there are multiple lines of text following each other and you don't want to use
text_wrap of your editor you should try using the `'` (single quote) for marking a line that has a whitespace character at the end of the line.

For ending a paragraph always use the pipe.

#### Examples:

**Singleline**
```slim
.textcontainer
  | Hello and Welcome
```
